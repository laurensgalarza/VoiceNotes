## Purpose
VoiceNotes was created to support auditory learners who benefit from listening rather than reading. The goal was to build a creative and accessible tool that transforms class notes or study materials into engaging, podcast-style narratives — powered by AI.

By allowing learners to select story type, genre, grade level, and narration style, VoiceNotes makes studying feel more personalized, creative, and even entertaining.

## User Flow
1. Enter a topic and/or upload study material in a pdf format.
2. Customize the story direction: desired grade level, genre, story type (educational or creative), and narration style (first or third person).
3. Press the generate button and wait as a podcast-style story is generated using OpenRouter API.
4. View your story and listen to the Google TTS audio conversion.
5. Download the mp3 file and start listening!
